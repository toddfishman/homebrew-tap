  # GitHub homepage is now a 404 for every visitor and `brew audit --strict`
  # checks that this URL resolves. Installs only ever use `url`, so this was
  # never load-bearing — it is the link a human clicks from `brew info`.

  # The bottle is a combined work: the core/scan/cli/attic crates are
  # MIT OR Apache-2.0, but stowit-brain (the eviction planner) is proprietary
  # and links into the same binary. There is no SPDX expression for that, and
  # `license "MIT OR Apache-2.0"` would have been a false claim about the thing
  # Homebrew actually installs. :cannot_represent is Homebrew's documented
  # escape hatch for exactly this case.
